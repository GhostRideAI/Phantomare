## 🚧 UNDER DEVELOPMENT 🚧
Phantomare is still in the early stages and under heavy development.

## About
Phantomare is a model-based RL algorithm originating from [Dreamer-V3](https://danijar.com/project/dreamerv3/) with the goal of:

- Easy port to new problems
- Fast execution, training
- Clean code & design
- Good documentation

## TODO
- [X] conda -> venv
- [ ] Unit test suite (1D env for training quick tests?)
- [ ] Fix ReplayBuffer checkpoints
- [ ] Support discrete action spaces
- [ ] Verify performance on more baseline environments
- [ ] mypy typing
- [ ] Design front-end UI / API
- [ ] Support loading pretrained world-models
- [ ] Support training world-model on offline data
- [ ] algorithm speed ups (is torch scan available now?)
- [ ] Align algorithm with Dreamer V3 updates
- [ ] add evaluation cycle during training
- [ ] Support remote data collector
- [ ] Plan2Explore
- [ ] support training behavior on expert data
- [ ] Support PlaNet style behavior (planning/roll-out)
- [ ] explore alternative architectures (e.g., transformer-based)
